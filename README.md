Ampersand is designed to provide users a simple and streamlined workflow for generating their OpenFOAM case files.

You can use Ampersand for external and internal incompressible flows. The case file generation procedure is very simple. You need to locate your STL file and answer a few YES/NO and multiple choice questions. Ampersand will take care of the rest including mesh size and y+, boundary conditions and numerical schemes.

You can see the demonstration of this code in this following YouTube video:
